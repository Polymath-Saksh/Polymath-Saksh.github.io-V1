        I am a passion-driven student, currently pursuing Dual Degrees from IIT- Madras and Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham,
        of BS(Data Science and Applications) and BTech(Computer Science and Engineering with a specialization in AI)
        respectively. I received cum laude from Delhi Public School, Ranchi(2021) and summa cum laude from Bishop
        Westcott Boys' School(2019), where I have participated and won in various English, General Knowledge, Computer
        Olympiads and Competitions.
        <br><br>
        At the age of 18, I was offered admission at Yale University, Connecticut, United States for their Bachelor's
        program.
        <br><br>
        Throughout my academic journey, I have worked out my skills in Penetration Testing, DB Manipulation, Web
        Development and Coding Competitions. I am always eager to lead my team to give their best to accomplish a task.
        <br><br>
        I am interested in the Penetration Testing and Machine Learning domain and looking forward to a
        research-oriented career in AI-FinTech prospects. Hobbies include guitar, quizzing and exploration.
        <br><br>
        I co-founded Technity Club at Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Amaravati Campus, and am currently playing a major
        role in events, guest seminar and competitive coding.
